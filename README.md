# CodeHighlighter
This plugin was made to highlight code in websites. If you have an element in your page that contains code, you just call a function on it and everything gets a specific class. Then CSS makes ist look similar to what you are used to from Notepad++. So far I have implemented HTML, CSS, JavaScript and PHP. There might be things that are not marked or that are marked incorrectly, so if you find a mistake just let me know. Also, you should avoid valid html-tags inside of your code element (they might confuse the browser!). I.e. you shouldn't have a &lt;/html> but instead you could use \&lt;/html>, which the browser would not recognize as the html being closed.

Requires jQuery.
